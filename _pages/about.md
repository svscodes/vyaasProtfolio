Hi, I'm **Vyaas**. I am a final-year Computer Science & Business Systems student at **SRM Institute of Science and Technology**, currently holding a **9.56/10 GPA**.

I am a software engineer who loves building tools that solve real developer problems. My focus is on **Backend Engineering**, **System Design**, and **Developer Tooling**. 

I don't just write code; I ship products. most recently, I architected and published **[LeetLink](YOUR_CHROME_STORE_LINK)**, a Chrome Extension that automates coding portfolios by syncing LeetCode submissions to GitHub.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, JavaScript (ES6+), SQL (PostgreSQL), HTML/CSS  
**Frameworks:** FastAPI, Node.js, Express.js, PyTorch  
**Tools:** Git/GitHub, Chrome Extension API (Manifest V3), Docker, MongoDB  
**Core Concepts:** System Design, Data Structures & Algorithms, REST APIs

## 🚀 Key Highlights
* **Published Developer Tool:** Built a Chrome Extension with **Manifest V3** and **Script Injection** techniques to bypass browser security constraints.
* **Backend Architecture:** Designed multi-tenant systems using **FastAPI** and **MongoDB** for scalable organization management.
* **System Internals:** Built a Unix-like **Shell** from scratch in JavaScript to understand process execution and OS fundamentals.
