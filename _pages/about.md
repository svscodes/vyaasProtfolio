Hi! I’m **Vyaas**. I’m a final-year CS student at **SRM Institute** with a **9.56 GPA** (which mostly means I'm good at reading documentation *very* fast).

While I appreciate a good theory class, I’m an engineer at heart. I don't just watch tutorials; I break things until I understand how they work, then rebuild them better. My obsession lies in **Backend Engineering**, **System Internals**, and building **Dev Tools** that make life easier for other developers.

Currently, I’m specializing in building scalable systems that don't crash when you look at them wrong.

## 🧪 The "Mad Scientist" Projects

I like building things that sound difficult just to see if I can. Here are a few:

### 🚀 **[LeetLink (Chrome Extension)](YOUR_STORE_LINK_HERE)**
* ** The Problem:** Manually copying LeetCode solutions to GitHub is boring and I am lazy.
* **The Solution:** I built a Manifest V3 extension that does it automatically.
* **The Fun Part:** I had to architect a script-injection bridge to bypass Chrome's "Isolated World" security just to steal the code from the editor. It was secure, ethical hacking for the sake of laziness.

### 🐚 **Unix Shell (from scratch)**
* **The Problem:** I wanted to know how `ls -la` *actually* works.
* **The Solution:** I wrote my own Shell in Node.js.
* **The Fun Part:** I implemented my own REPL, process forking, and piping. Now I respect the terminal a lot more.

### 🤖 **FoodPicker AI**
* **The Problem:** My friends and I never know what to eat.
* **The Solution:** I trained a PyTorch model to decide for us.
* **The Result:** It automated 90% of our arguments.

## 🛠 My Arsenal (Tech Stack)

* **Languages I speak fluently:** Python, JavaScript (ES6+), SQL.
* **Languages I speak with a dictionary:** C++, Java.
* **Frameworks:** FastAPI (my favorite), Node.js, Express, PyTorch.
* **Tools:** Git, Docker, Chrome Extension API, Postman.
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL (the reliable one), MongoDB (the flexible one).

## ⚡ What I'm Looking For
I am looking for **Backend** or **Full Stack** roles where I can write clean code, solve distributed system problems, and maybe argue about why Vim is better than VS Code (okay, maybe not that last part).
